                <h3 class="content">Feeding:</h3>
                <p>
                    Feed puppies aged eight to 12 weeks four meals a day, reduce to three meals for three to six months old, and further to two meals for six months to one year. After the first birthday, one meal is typically sufficient. For some dogs, especially larger ones or those prone to bloat, two smaller meals may be better. Premium dry food offers a balanced diet, with options to mix with water, broth, or canned food. While dogs may enjoy cottage cheese, cooked egg, or fruits and vegetables, these additions should not exceed 10% of daily intake. Opt for high-quality puppy food for optimal development, limiting "people food" to prevent imbalances and health issues. Ensure constant access to clean water and regularly clean food and water dishes.
                </p>
                <h3 class="content">Exercise:</h3>
                <p>
                    Regular exercise is crucial for dogs to burn calories, stimulate their minds, and maintain overall health. Individual exercise requirements depend on factors like breed, sex, age, and health status. Tailor activities to satisfy specific instinctual urges such as digging, herding, chewing, retrieving, and chasing. Exercise not only prevents boredom but also helps deter destructive behaviors. Supervised fun and games are effective in meeting these needs, contributing to a happy and healthy canine companion.
                </p>
                <h3 class="content">Grooming:</h3>
                <p>
                    Maintain your dog's cleanliness and minimize shedding by brushing regularly. In warm weather, check for fleas and ticks daily. Limit baths to a few times a year, and before bathing, address any mats in the coat by combing or cutting them out. Thoroughly rinse the coat to remove all soap residue, preventing dirt from sticking. This grooming routine helps keep your dog healthy and comfortable.
                </p>
                <h3 class="content">Healthcare:</h3>
                <p>
                    Dogs should receive regular veterinary care to prevent and treat health problems. This includes vaccinations, parasite control, dental care, and spaying/neutering. Dogs should also be protected from hazards such as toxic foods, plants, and chemicals.
